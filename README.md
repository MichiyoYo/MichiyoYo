### Hi there, this is Cree! ðŸ¦„

I'm a frontend-heavy full stack developer, UX designer and illustrator, with a burning passion for beautiful, responsive and fast web applications. As I grow as a developer, I work on making my code DRY, readable, scalable, maintainable, reusable and performant. I'm excited by new challenges and I never want to stop learning.

My personal contribution chart looks a little empty, but during the past 2 years I've been contributing to private repos with a separate, private account I cannot share. This is what it looks like though!
