### Hi there, this is Cree! 🦄

I'm a full stack developer, UX designer and illustrator, with a buring passion for beautiful, responsive and fast web applications. As I grow as a developer, I work on making my code beautiful, readable, scalable, maintainable, reusable and performant. I'm excited by new challenges and I never want to stop learning.
When I don't code I spend my time practicing yoga, lifing heavy things, training Muay Thai Kickboxing, painting, making music and petting my cat Mochi 🐈‍⬛
