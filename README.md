### Hi there, this is Cree! 🦄

I'm a frontend-heavy full stack developer, UX designer and illustrator, with a burning passion for beautiful, responsive and fast web applications. As I grow as a developer, I work on making my code DRY, readable, scalable, maintainable, reusable and performant. I'm excited by new challenges and I never want to stop learning.
When I don't code I spend my time practicing yoga, lifing heavy things, training Muay Thai Kickboxing, painting, making music and petting my cat Mochi and my dog Coco!

My main skills are: 
- 👕✨DRY & Clean coding
- 🚀 Performance Optimization
- 👩‍🔬 Problem Solving
- 📐 UX Prototyping
- 🐛 Debugging
- 👌 Site Reliability
- 💻 System Management
- 🧪 Test Driven Development
- 🥞 NoSQL / SQL Databases
- 🔥 Extra Fast Learning
- 🎨 Raster/Vector Illustration
- 🙏 Teamwork
